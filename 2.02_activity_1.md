# 2.02 Activity 1

Keep working on the `bank` database. (_In case you need to load data again, refer to `files_for_lab` to get the database._)

#### Simple queries

1. Select districts and salaries (from the `district` table) where salary is greater than 10000. Suggestion is to use the case study extended here (you have it already after getting the 2.01 activity) to work out which columns are required here. Return columns as `district_name` and `average_salary`.
2. Select those loans whose contract finished and were not paid.

   **Hint**: You should be looking at the `loan` table and you will need the extended case study information to tell you which value of status is required.

3. Select cards of type `junior`. Return just first 10 in your query.
